								<p>I am a Senior Engineer with over a decade of experience dedicated to the art and science of data. My career began in the world of Java Development, where I learned the discipline of building robust, scalable backend systems. Over 11 years, that passion evolved. I realized that the most powerful applications aren't just those that run smoothly, but those that leverage data to tell a story.</p>
								<p>Today, I sit at the intersection of <b>Software Engineering</b> and <b>Data Architecture</b>. I specialize in building the "pipes" and the "brains" of modern enterprises—using Java to create high-performance applications and Snowflake/Cloud ecosystems to transform raw data into a strategic asset. </p>
								<h3>My Technical Philosophy</h3>
								<p>I don't just build features; I build ecosystems. Whether I am architecting an ELT pipeline or designing a Microservices architecture, I am guided by three principles:</p>
<strong>Scalability:</strong> Systems must handle today&rsquo;s load and tomorrow&rsquo;s growth without breaking.
<p><strong>Reliability:</strong> In data and backend engineering, "mostly working" isn't enough. I strive for 99.9% uptime and data integrity.</p>
<p><strong>Clarity:</strong> Code should be as readable as it is functional. Complex data should be as accessible as it is deep.</p>
<h3 data-path-to-node="12"><strong data-path-to-node="12" data-index-in-node="0">What I Bring to the Table</strong></h3>
<ul data-path-to-node="13">
<li>
<strong data-path-to-node="13,2,0" data-index-in-node="0">The Analytical Mind:</strong> As a Data Analyst, I don&rsquo;t just move data; I interpret it. I use SQL, Python, and BI tools to provide the "why" behind the numbers.
</li>
<li>
<strong data-path-to-node="13,0,0" data-index-in-node="0">The Java Specialist:</strong> 11 years of deep-diving into Core Java, Spring Boot, and Hibernate. I&rsquo;ve built transaction-heavy systems that serve millions of users with sub-second latency.
</li>
<li>
	<strong data-path-to-node="13,3,0" data-index-in-node="0">The Data Architect:</strong> Expert in Snowflake and ELT development. I have a proven track record of migrating massive legacy datasets into optimized cloud environments, reducing costs and increasing query speeds by up to 60%.</li>
<li>
<p data-path-to-node="13,3,0"><strong data-path-to-node="13,3,0" data-index-in-node="0">The Communicator:</strong> I bridge the gap between technical teams and business stakeholders. I pride myself on translating complex technical constraints into clear business opportunities.</p>
</li>

<h3 data-path-to-node="15"><strong data-path-to-node="15" data-index-in-node="0">Experience Across the Globe &amp; Domains</strong></h3>
<p data-path-to-node="16">My journey has taken me through diverse domains, including Healthcare, Education, Pharma and Consumer. This diversity has taught me that while technologies change, the core challenge remains the same: <strong data-path-to-node="16" data-index-in-node="269">How do we use technology to make better decisions, faster?</strong></p>
<h3 data-path-to-node="18"><strong data-path-to-node="18" data-index-in-node="0">Beyond the Screen</strong></h3>
<p data-path-to-node="19">When I&rsquo;m not optimizing SQL queries or debugging Java microservices, I am a lifelong learner. I stay active in the tech community, keep my certifications current (including Snowflake, SQL, AI). I believe that 11 years of experience isn't just a number it's a responsibility to lead and innovate.</p>
<p data-path-to-node="20"><strong data-path-to-node="20" data-index-in-node="0">Let&rsquo;s Build Something Meaningful Together.</strong> I am currently open to senior-level roles and consulting opportunities. If you are looking for a partner who can handle the full lifecycle of data from ingestion to application let&rsquo;s connect.</p>
